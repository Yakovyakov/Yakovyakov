## Professional Experience

### Lead Linux Systems Engineer  
**Centro Principal de Cálculo** – Havana, Cuba  
*2005 – Present*

Over two decades, I have led multiple high-impact technical projects, evolving from systems engineer to technical architect and team leader.

#### Custom Operating System (Linux Gentoo) | 2009 – Present
- **Architect, Developer, Maintainer**  
- Designed and built a custom OS from scratch for a large-scale network of +500 nodes, based on Gentoo Linux.  
- Optimized the kernel by removing unnecessary modules and tuning the network stack (TCP BBR, dynamic buffers).  
- Automated deployment: reduced setup time from 2h to 20 min per server.  
- Continuous kernel upgrades (3.x → 4.x → 5.x) and proactive CVE patching.

#### Secure Email System | 2010 – Present
- **Architect, Developer, Maintainer**  
- Developed a custom SMTP/POP3 server in C and a client in Delphi/C++.  
- Built a custom C/C++ library for efficient client-server communication.  
- Managed 1,000+ active users and reduced security incidents by 60%.  
- Ongoing maintenance: vulnerability fixes and protocol updates.

#### High Availability System (Active-Passive) | 2011 – Present
- **Full Stack Developer, DevOps**  
- Implemented automatic failover with <5 seconds recovery time using Virtual IP (VIP) and gratuitous ARP.  
- Developed monitoring scripts in Bash/Python for real-time failure detection (ping, netstat).

#### Parallel Packet Processing for High-Encryption VPN | 2015 – Present
- **Network Engineer**  
- Software-only solution to scale performance from 200 MB/s to 850 MB/s on 1 Gb/s networks.  
- Modified RPS (Receive Packet Steering) and designed a CPU load-balancing algorithm.  
- Validated with iperf3: achieved 85% of theoretical bandwidth.

## Personal Projects

### Web Monitoring Automation Tool  
*2023 – Present*  
Technologies: Python, Selenium, Redis, Docker, REST APIs  
- Automated system to detect changes on websites and trigger real-time alerts.  
- Task queuing with Redis to manage load and prevent server overload.  
- Scheduled execution via cron and notifications (email/Telegram).  
- Low-impact design: delays, `robots.txt` compliance.  
- Built for ethical tracking of high-demand products.
