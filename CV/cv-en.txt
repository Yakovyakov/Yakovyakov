- Managed 1,000+ active users and reduced security incidents by 60%.
- Ongoing maintenance: vulnerability fixes and protocol updates.

High Availability System (Active-Passive) | 2011 – Present
- Implemented automatic failover with recovery time under 5 seconds using Virtual IP (VIP) and gratuitous ARP.
- Developed monitoring scripts in Bash and Python for real-time failure detection (ping, netstat).

Parallel Packet Processing for High-Encryption VPN | 2015 – Present
- Scaled VPN server performance from 200 MB/s to 850 MB/s by modifying RPS and implementing CPU load balancing.
- Software-only solution without hardware acceleration. Validated with iperf3.

PERSONAL PROJECTS

Web Monitoring Automation Tool | 2023 – Present
- Automated system to detect changes on websites and trigger real-time alerts.
